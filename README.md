This project leverages the UCI Energy Efficiency Dataset to predict heating and cooling loads of buildings and provide actionable recommendations for optimizing energy usage. Using RapidMiner, we perform data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and build machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Linear Regression) to identify key factors influencing energy efficiency.

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.
Modeling: Predictive analysis for heating and cooling loads.
Insights: Recommendations for improving building design and energy efficiency based on model outputs.
